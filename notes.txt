Q:
	if i have two objects and i want to check 
	both are using same memory or not how can i ?

ans:
	we can print hashcode of object using toString()
	in simple we print object in s.o.p 
	and we got hashcode of objects if both are same 
	it means they are refering same memory address 	
	else not 
singleton :- 

when we add scope="prototype" in spring.xml 

IoC container will create new object every time ,
when you ask using getBean 


when i want to create new connection every time for faster perfomance. 

now IoC container will not manage life of that prototype instance, so you are responsible to release 
memory of that instance. 

this is just for alteration in spring , spring will not strict with us for singleton design pattern.

spring bean -->scope 
	singleton
	prototype*
	request
	session
	global-session  

we  can also use other scope 
like,
	request
	session
	global-session

above three can used in web application 



user - 500 - open connection --> logout 
prototype --> open --> task-->close 



--------------------------

IoC container also have initliazing and destroy support like servlet.

object => create --> xyz()  
	  destory --> def() 

servlet --> init / destroy 


ListProductController -- server 
	UserDao -- controller -- new -- 

userDao is depen. of ListProductController 

can i have any solution  ? that make sure when every i am accessing ListProductController, i have UserDao ready?


class ListProductController{

	UserDao userDao;
	ListProductController(UserDao ud){
		this.userDao = ud;
	}

}

UserDao ud = new UserDao();
ListProuctController l = new ListProductController(ud); // correct??

DI 

1)  constructor injection 
2)  setter injection
